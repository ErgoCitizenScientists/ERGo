## `erg`

Package to open an ERG data files in the form `BYB_Recording_YYYY-MM-DD_HH.MM.SS.wav` and `BYB_Recording_YYYY-MM-DD_HH.MM.SS.txt`. Located in `C:\Users\USER\Documents\BYB`.

Is NOT YET a formal module. Confer with the 103a recitation on modules to get it there.

## `software_module`

All of your custom made functions, processing routines, and analysis methods should be given here either as a formal software module or, at a minimum, a single file with enumerated functions that can be directly called. I have not provided an example here as it is highly dependent on the programming language used.
